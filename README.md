 <h2> Hi there, I am Prachi Nandi </a> </h2>
  <p> I am currently a software engineer working at Microsoft. I graduated from National Institute of Technology Rourkela, with honours in Computer Science and Engineering.
 I have been learning quantitative finanace and wish to learn more on real word applications of ML in finance sector. 
   
  Not so fun fact about me but I can talk a lot if the conversations revolve around art, books, politics, history or phillosophy.
